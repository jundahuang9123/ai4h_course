Over the course of multiple practical sessions, you will learn how to understand the code that underlies applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare. You will also learn how to implement AI models by yourself. Programming is a skill that is acquired by hands-on experience and typically requires a lot of training. During this course we will not be able to make you an expert programmer, but we aim to introduce you to the different ingredients that come into play when creating an AI model. \n","\n","In any AI project, your data is your most crucial ingredient. In this session, we will start by introducing some ways to get a better understanding of your data. Along the way we will introduce several Python packages that are very often used when running an AI project.
