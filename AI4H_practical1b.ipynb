Global prevalence of osteoarthritis is increasing and the burden of the disease will rise. The medical cost of osteoarthritis in various high-income countries has been estimated to account for between 1% and 2.5% of the gross domestic product of these countries, with hip and knee joint replacements representing the major proportion of these healthcare costs.\n","\n","Joint replacement surgery is a clinically relevant and cost-effective treatment for end-stage osteoarthritis. The characteristics of end-stage osteoarthritis include joint pain, which disrupts normal sleep patterns and causes a severe reduction in capable walking distance and marked restriction of daily activities. Hence, the aim of knee and hip replacements is to alleviate pain and disability in daily functioning.\n","\n","However, up to 25% of patients presenting for total joint replacement continue to complain of pain and disability 1 year after well-performed surgery. With data available on thousands of patients, the question arises to what extent it is possible to predict treatment success. This could be useful in supporting doctors in deciding whether knee replacement is indicated, and could help give patients a more personalized assessment of what to expect of treatment.\n","\n","_see [narrative seminar Osteoarthritis by Hunter & Bierma-Zeinstra (2019) in the Lancet](https://github.com/dkapitan/jads-nhs-proms/blob/master/references/hunter2019osteaoarthritis.pdf) for more background information._"],"metadata":{"id":"hSGnFmDnyXOY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","# Business understanding\n","Assume that the primary reasons to replace a knee are to **i) reduce pain**, and **ii) improve daily functioning**.
